## Some notes
#### OpenAI Model Usage
In order to see data from the OpenAI model, you will need to have your own OpenAI API key. You can get one by signing up for the beta [here](https://platform.openai.com/overview). Then, store the key in an enviornment variable called `OPENAI_TOKEN`. You can do this by running the following line in your terminal...
```
export OPENAI_TOKEN=<your key here>
```
